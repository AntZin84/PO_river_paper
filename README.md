# PO_river_paper
This README provides a step-by-step guide to reproduce the results and figures presented in the paper on the Po River. Each step corresponds to specific code files and instructions for execution. Ensure you have Stata for seeing the data.

Ensure that all required files are in the same directory for easier execution.

- Execute the Code_und_LAST.txt script to perform the analysis for the undirected network.

- Execute the Code_directed_last.txt script to perform the analysis for the directed network.

- Run the script to generate network statistics and visualizations for both types (Code_und_LAST.txt and Code_directed_last.txt).

- Open the code_distance.txt file and execute the first block of code to calculate the initial distance metrics.

Notes:
Ensure that all scripts are run sequentially to avoid errors due to missing intermediate results.
Save all outputs in the designated folders to ensure figures and results align with the paper's presentation.

Shapefile: Po River Basin
The shapefile containing the boundaries of the Po River Basin was obtained from the official website of the Po River Basin Authority. This dataset provides the official hydrological boundaries of the Po Basin.

Shapefile: Lakes and Rivers
The shapefiles for global lakes and river networks were sourced from the HydroSHEDS project. These datasets are ideal for hydrological and ecological studies.
